**Mamba** is a programming language with full Python syntax compatibility that transpiles to Rust and compiles to native binaries.

> **Write Python-style code. Ship fast, native executables. No Python. No Rust. No setup.**

---

## ✨ Features

- 100% Python syntax (for/while, variables, functions, conditionals, data structures)
- Transpiles to Rust for native performance
- Single installer per platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- No external dependencies for users
- Clean, unified CLI and diagnostics

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Coming soon: Install Mamba
